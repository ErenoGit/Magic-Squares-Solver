My web application written in .NET Core makes it easy and quick to solve the logic puzzles that are magic squares.

##### Instructions:

- into the boxes with a green background, enter the numbers to come out after performing mathematical operations on the given numbers in a given row or column
- into the boxes with a purple background, enter the type of mathematical action (+, -, * or /)

After completing the required fields and clicking on the "Solve magic square!" button, the numbers that are the solution to the magic square will appear in the grey fields.
